Make relative URLs absolute, in order to fix RSS feeds.

== Description ==

RSS Base will rewrite all relative link and image tags (`<a>` and `<img>`) to include a base URL.

RSS feeds require absolute URLs to both validate and function properly.

Feed readers can become confused when seeing relative paths, because they wonâ€™t necessarily know what base URL to use. A suggested [update to the RSS standard](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/relativeURI.html "") has not been widely adopted.

This plugin uses code from [Gerd Riesselmann](http://www.gerd-riesselmann.net/archives/2005/11/rss-doesnt-know-a-base-url/ "RSS doesn't know a base-URL")

== Installation ==

1. Upload `rss-base.php` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate RSS Base through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to the "RSS Base" options page and set your base URL.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is a post's permalink used when determining the absolute URL? =

No, currently this plugin only finds every relative link in posts and comments, and prefixes those links with the base URL you choose in your options.
